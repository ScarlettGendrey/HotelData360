# HotelData360

This project involves creating a comprehensive database for a hypothetical hotel management system designed to cover various aspects of hotel operations. 
The aim is to develop and utilize a rich dataset to practice and enhance skills in SQL, data analysis, and visualization. 
The database schema includes tables for customer information, room bookings, event management, staff details, and financial transactions, among others. This project will also involve generating synthetic data to populate these tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency. 
The end goal is to use this database for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and more advanced data modeling, providing insights into customer behavior, operational efficiency, and revenue management.

## Objectives
- Develop a relational database schema suitable for a hotel management system.
- Generate synthetic data to populate the database.
